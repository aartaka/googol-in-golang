#+TITLE:Googol in Golang

Googol is 10 to the power of 100. This is
- A huge number.
- It's one that is interesting to get with any calculator
  - especially with the ones called programming languages!
- It also sounds like the name of the company that supported Go
  creation, and that's fun.

This repo is my way to learn Go, one feature at a time, with the task
always staying the same -- get Googol in the end! Some tasks are
repetitive, but all of them bring new bits of knowledge to me (see
"Primary takeaways" comment in every file to know what these bits
are).

Files are numbered and (mostly) named after the main features
involved, so you can trace my way and the order I learned things in.
